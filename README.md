# Conventional-Neural-Network-Dog-Breed-Classifier
In this project, I build a convolutional neural network (CNN) that can classify the breed of dog from any user-supplied image. If the image is of a human and not a dog, the algorithm will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling.

The code is written in Python 3 and Keras with Tensorflow backend all presented in Jupyter Notebook. I used AWS EC2 gpu instance for training the model.
